# elderScrolls-rpg-gmtool
gm tool with different random generators for use in Elder Scrolls themed tabletop RPG.

Use the file elderscrolls-gmhelper.py to run the program.

The Different Tabs
The Enchanting: This is a calculation for enchanting effects I have used in my campaign.
NpcGen: randomly generates race and gender
WeatherGen: randomly generates weather based on areas, the percentages it uses for generating the different types of weahter are taken from the games Morrowind and Oblivion.
Alchemy: You can either choose an ingredient and it show the different effects it has or you can choose an effect and it will show you what ingredient has that effect.


Future ideas:
Random name generator for the NpcGen.
Weather for other territories
Equipment list with pricecost where you can choose different priceranges instead of having to calculate them yourself.



This program needs to be updated and the structure is quite messy, since it is my first program and I am selftaught.
